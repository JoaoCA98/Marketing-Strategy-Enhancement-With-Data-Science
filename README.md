# Marketing Strategy Enhancement with Data Science

## Project Context

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its profound impact on the global tourism industry, the Portuguese National Tourism Board Organization (PT – NTBO) seeks to revitalize its marketing strategies. By harnessing the power of Data Science, the organization aims to develop innovative approaches that will elevate Portugal's tourism industry to new heights.

## Approach & Strategy

Our project strategy revolves around a comprehensive exploration of the Portuguese tourism landscape. To achieve this, we adopted the CRISP-DM methodology and leveraged the Python programming language. We employed concepts such as the RFM Model for segmentation and Similarity analysis to derive insightful recommendations.

**Main Business Goals:**
- Present a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact by comparing scenarios before and after Covid-19.
- Formulate a targeted marketing strategy by identifying the most promising visitor segments, those who exhibit high frequency, short intervals between visits, and positive ratings.
- Develop a recommendation system that highlights the advantages of visiting Portugal compared to its competitors.
